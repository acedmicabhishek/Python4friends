# Python for Biology Simulations: Syllabus

This track explore the intersection of Python and Biological systems, focusing on modeling and simulation techniques.

## 1. Mathematical Modeling Basics
- Formulating biological processes into equations
- Introduction to ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) in biology

## 2. Modeling Population Dynamics
- Exponential and Logistic growth models
- Predator-Prey models (Lotka-Volterra equations)
- Multi-species interactions and competition

## 3. Computational Biochemistry
- Enzyme Kinetics (Michaelis-Menten modeling)
- Metabolic Pathway simulation
- Introduction to Stochastic simulations (Gillespie algorithm)

## 4. Bio-inspired Algorithms
- Genetic Algorithms (Evolutionary computation)
- Swarm Intelligence models (Ant colony, Flocking behavior)
- Neural modeling basics

## 5. Tools of the Trade
- **SciPy**: Solving differential equations with `odeint`
- **NetworkX**: Modeling biological networks (Protein-Protein interactions)
- **Matplotlib/Animation**: Creating dynamic visualizations of simulations

## 6. Project: Epidemic Modeling
- Building an SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model to simulate disease spread in a population.
